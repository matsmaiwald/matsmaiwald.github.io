In this post, I wanna give a brief overview of the DeepAR forecasting model.

## Objective

Given a panel data set, we want a probability distribution over future realisations of each time series. 
So given the historical realisations of the panel 
$$\{\boldsymbol{z}_{i,1:t_0}\}_{i=1, ..., N}$$, 
where $$[z_{i, 1}, z_{i, 2}, ... , z_{i,t_0}] := \boldsymbol{z}_{i, 1:t_0} $$ 
we want to obtain 
$$P(\boldsymbol{z}_{i,t_0:T}|) $$
