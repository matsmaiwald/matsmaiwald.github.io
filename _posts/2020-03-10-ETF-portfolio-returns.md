# What percentage of a portfolio should go to stocks vs bonds?
- depends on the investors preference over higher expected returns vs increased volatility
- To choose the optimal equity share given one's preferences, need to know the probability distribution of future portfolio returns

# We have little historical data on the performance of index-ETF portfolios
- low-cost portfolios based on a combination of stock and bond index-ETFs are very
    popular nowadays
- very little historical data on the performance of these portfolios, since most of them
    were created only after the financial crisis of 2008/2009

# Approximating index-ETF portfolio returns by looking at historical data
- in the absence of historical on the portfolios themselves, can look at historical data
    for their underlying components
- We have data for the S&P500 and treasuries (3-months and 10-years maturity) going back
    to 1928

# On average, stocks have higher returns but also higher volatility
